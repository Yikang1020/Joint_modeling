# Joint_modeling

test the technology of brain and behavior

Joint modeling 1 is the directed approach of linking neural data to behaviral parameter with HDDM

Joint modeling 2 is the directed approach of linking neural data to behaviral parameter and the covariable approach with pyjags, but the generalization tets failed due to missing data.
